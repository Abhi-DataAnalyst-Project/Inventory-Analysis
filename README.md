# Inventory-Analysis-Report

This project aimed to revolutionize inventory management by transforming raw data into strategic decision-making gold.

Key Features & Technique used

ETL Process: Employing robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, I transformed complex raw inventory data into a coherent, structured dataset, laying the foundation for powerful analyses.

DAX-EX: With the help of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I engineered intricate calculations, metrics, and KPIs, uncovering deep-seated trends and patterns within the inventory data.

Drill-Through Magic: Leveraging the drill-through function, I enabled stakeholders to dive into the nitty-gritty details of inventory items, fostering a profound understanding of their behavior and performance.

Sales Forecasting : Through cutting-edge forecasting techniques, I predicted future demand with remarkable accuracy, paving the way for proactive inventory replenishment strategies.

Predictive Analytics : By integrating predictive models, I empowered the organization to predict potential out-of-stock and under-stock scenarios, mitigating costly disruptions.

Inventory Insights: Crafting dynamic dashboards, I visualized stock status, calculated expected prices for re-stocking, and tracked inventory turnover, ensuring a comprehensive grasp of inventory health.
Data Modeling: With meticulous data modeling and relationship building, I created a robust data foundation that allowed for seamless navigation and a 360-degree view of inventory dynamics.
